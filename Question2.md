AI BootCamp in India - online Meetup


This has been fantastic meetup, I never expected such a good training sesssions. I was always eager to learn prompt engineering and LLM, this meetup has shown a direction and setup a path forward. Earlier I just thought just writing 	questions we will get the expected answers from chatgpt, but there is also way how we frame the questions, and it is also important to know that we do not just waste time in having too many vague questions. After all it is system which is answering so if our input is vague and improper, we will expect such response, and it will confuse the system.
LLM is well engineered, how the language is parsed and tokens are generated with analysis, having semantic relations, and system will generate based on the given input and the large data analysis, is awesome.
Thanks DataArt for such good sessions, would like to have more sessions, and also know how they are creating products around AI/ML and innovations.

The AI BootCamp in India online meetup exceeded all expectations, offering an exceptional training experience. As an attendee, I was particularly keen to delve into prompt engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs), and this meetup successfully provided a clear direction and roadmap for further exploration. It highlighted the importance of not only asking questions but also framing them effectively. We learned that vague queries can lead to vague responses, and it is crucial to provide the system with precise and well-structured input to obtain accurate and useful answers.


The insights into LLMs were fascinating, especially understanding how these models parse language, generate tokens, establish semantic connections, and produce outputs based on extensive data analysis. DataArt's organization of these sessions was commendable, and I extend my gratitude for such an informative event. I eagerly anticipate future meetups and look forward to gaining insights into DataArt's AI/ML product development processes and innovative endeavors.

Subject: Outstanding AI Bootcamp Meetup

I want to express my sincere gratitude for the exceptional AI Bootcamp meetup. The training sessions were incredibly informative and exceeded my expectations. I've always been fascinated by prompt engineering and LLMs, and this meetup provided a clear direction and roadmap for further exploration.

Previously, I had a simplistic understanding of LLMs, believing that simply asking questions would yield desired responses. However, this meetup highlighted the importance of effective prompt framing and the potential pitfalls of vague inquiries. It emphasized that the quality of the output depends on the clarity and specificity of the input, and that poorly constructed prompts can confuse the system.

The insights into LLM architecture and functionality were equally impressive. Learning about how language is parsed, tokens are generated, and semantic relationships are analyzed was enlightening. The ability of LLMs to generate coherent and relevant responses based on given inputs and vast datasets is truly remarkable.

I would like to extend my appreciation to DataArt for organizing such a valuable event. I hope to attend more sessions in the future and gain further insights into AI/ML applications and innovations.
