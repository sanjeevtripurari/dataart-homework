Skilled in archery
Loved to do his father's will
Bharat:
True valor
Every princely virtue
One fourth of Vishṇu manifest

High emprise
Devoted
True
Sharers in Vishṇu's essence too
Loved Ráma more than his life
Striving to please his elder brother
Always accompanied Ráma
Śatrughna:
Prized his Bharat's love above his life
Illustrious hero
Nobly kind

* ***Prompt***

The text does not explicitly state the month in which the princes were born. However, it does mention the specific day and constellation under which each prince was born:

Ráma: Ninth day of Chaitra, under the constellation Pūrvā Phalguni
Bharat: Ninth day of Chaitra, under the constellation Pushya
Lakshmaṇ: Tenth day of Chaitra, under the constellation Mūla
Śatrughna: Tenth day of Chaitra, under the constellation Mūla
Based on this information, we can infer that the princes were likely born in the month of Chaitra, which corresponds to the month of April in the Gregorian calendar.
